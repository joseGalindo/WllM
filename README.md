# WllM

This project is a personal challenge.

## Built With

*       [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) - Dependency Management
*       [git](https://git-scm.com/) - Free and Open-Source distributed version control system
*       [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) - Rx is a generic abstraction of computation expressed through Observable<Element> interface.

## Running the application
You can easily run the application into a device or a simulator, but first:
* [Clone](https://github.com/joseGalindo/WllM) - Clone the Git repository.
* 	Open Terminal and set into the directory, we need to configure project by installing dependencies with **CocoaPods**, we must type:
`$ pod install`
and then
`$ open WMTest.xcodeworkspace`

## To-Do

* 	[x] Unit Test
* 	[x] A very nice design
* 	[x] Filter by proximity
